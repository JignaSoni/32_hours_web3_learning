# Generalised learning plan & steps
============================================================================================

I'd be happy to help you in your journey to becoming a Solidity developer! Solidity is a programming language that is used to create smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Here are a few steps you can take to get started:

-- January 2023
1. Learn the basics of blockchain technology: Before diving into Solidity, it's important to have a basic understanding of how blockchain technology works. There are many resources available online, such as articles and tutorials, that can help you learn about the basics of blockchain and Ethereum.

2. Learn Solidity: Once you have a basic understanding of blockchain technology, you can start learning Solidity. There are many resources available online, such as the Solidity documentation, tutorials, and online courses, that can help you learn the language.

3. Practice writing smart contracts: As with any programming language, the best way to learn is by writing code. Look for tutorials, challenges or projects that will give you the opportunity to write and deploy smart contracts.

4. Get familiar with development tools and environment: There are several development tools and environment that are commonly used when developing smart contracts, such as Truffle, Embark, and Ganache. These tools will help you test and deploy your contracts.

5. Practice writing test cases and debug smart contracts: Writing test cases and debugging smart contracts is an important part of development process. Try to understand how to use testing frameworks like Truffle's test runner, and how to use debugging tools like Remix's debugger.

6. Join a community: The blockchain and Ethereum communities are vibrant and supportive, and many developers are happy to help newcomers. Joining a community like this can be a great way to learn from more experienced developers and get feedback on your work.

Keep learning: Blockchain and Ethereum are constantly evolving, and new developments are happening all the time. Keep learning about new developments and updates in the ecosystem, and try to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices.
